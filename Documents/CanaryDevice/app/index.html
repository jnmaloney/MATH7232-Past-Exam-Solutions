        <h3>Geospatial</h3>
                <p>Geospatial and GIS services collect immense volumes of data as LiDAR point clouds, which have been challenging to incorporate into real-time visualisation. Novel applications with point cloud rendering and streaming allows real-time access to all of this data.</p>

        <h3>Point Cloud Data</h3>
        <p>Almost all modern 3D applications use polygon meshes because they offer fast rendering of large surfaces. Point cloud rendering software offers a greater amount of information to be displayed and is required where meshes are not available, such as in LiDAR scans and surveys. Point cloud rendering also offers an adaptive level of detail over the entire scene which helps by allowing large datasets to be streamed into memory, which is much faster than loading the entire data set.</p>

        <h3>Scientific</h3>
        <p>Exotic types of matter can be studied in a laboratory, which enhance our understanding of the laws of physics. Direct observation of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) will add energy (light) to the system, which destroys the fragile balance of atoms in a super chilled container, almost absolute zero. Simulations are able to predict the behaviour of exotic fluids and their properties.  Simulations such as these, combined with direct observations are pushing the boundaries of material science.</p>

                    <p>
                    These screenshots demonstrate the different layers of a skinned animation shader. The shader itself is divided into two parts, for vertex and pixel shading.</p><p>
                    The vertex shader takes as input the animation data (a heirarchy of matrix transforms for each bone and the skin weighting for each vertex). The output is the skinned mesh in the desired animation pose. This is updated every frame and allows for animation blending for smooth transitions between standing and walking loops. This part of the shader calculates the vertex position and normals for the pose.</p><p>
                    The pixel shader calculates the lighting effects after the pose has been calculated. This requires the use of several texture maps to generate realistic lighting. Three texture maps are used, and each channel is encoded with the required data. The model uses an albedo (diffue) map, specular highlights map, normal map, ambient occlusion map, global (indirect lighting) map, and self shadowing map.</p><p>
                    All these lighting images are combined together to form a realistic looking character within the scene.
